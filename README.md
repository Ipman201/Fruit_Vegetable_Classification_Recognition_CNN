# Fruit_Vegetable_Classification_Recognition_CNN

This project is about Fruits & Vegetable classification and Recognition. User need to upload the Image of any fruit or vegetable. This system will automatically classify the Image and it will give you the prediction about the name of fruit or vegetable, and calories of the predicted object.

I successfully got the 95% accuracy using sequential model.
